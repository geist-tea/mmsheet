You can bestow your hero point or use of Luck on others. You can use this only once on any given character in a round, but the recipient may use the bestowed point(s) normally.You can spend one of your hero point or uses of the Luck advantage to negate the use of a hero point by someone else, use of their Luck advantage, or a Gamemaster-imposed complication (at the discretion of the GM). The latter also eliminates the complication, however, so no hero points are awarded for it.You can spend a hero point or use Luck to force someone else to re-roll a die roll and take the worse of the two rolls. The target of this last effect may spend a hero point or use Luck to avoid having to re-roll.",

By taking a move action to concentrate you can increase this by +1 Str, changing the duration of the effect to Concentration (see Duration at the start of this chapter). This is in addition to using extra effort to further increase your rank (see Extra Effort, page 19).This effect can move objects, but cannot perform tasks of fine manipulation (like untying knots, typing, or manipulating controls) without the Precise modifier. Objects thrown into targets as attacks base their damage off your power rank as if it were your Strength rank.Move Object cannot inflict damage directly; you cannot “punch” or “crush” objects with it. You can use it to make disarm, grab, and trip attacks. See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.",

If you are targeting the subject of an effect rather than the effect of the user, make an opposed check of Nullify rank vs. effect rank.
